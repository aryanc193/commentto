# Commentto

**Commentto** is an AI-powered tool that summarizes long-form content and generates thoughtful comments in the user’s writing voice.

It is designed to be **fast, local-first, and frictionless**, and available as both a **web app** and a **production-ready Chrome extension** build for real-world, in-context usage.

---

## What Commentto Does

* Summarizes long articles, posts, or pages
* Generates short, thoughtful comments
* Matches a chosen writing voice (preset or custom)
* Works instantly from the browser
* Requires no accounts or sign-ups

---

## Key Product Decisions

* **Local-first**: Custom voices are stored locally (no accounts, no DB)
* **Privacy-friendly**: No user data is persisted server-side
* **Extension-first**: Optimized for real usage, not demos
* **Shared architecture**: Web and extension reuse the same domain logic

---

## Architecture Overview

This repository is a **pnpm monorepo** with shared packages and two apps.

```

### Backend

* Implemented using **Next.js App Router API routes**
* No separate server or database
* Deployed on **Vercel**
* Handles:

  * Content summarization
  * Voice profile derivation
  * Comment generation

### Chrome Extension

* Manifest V3
* Uses explicit content script injection
* Communicates with background worker
* Persists state using `chrome.storage.local`

> Note: The extension is currently distributed via manual loading (developer mode) and not yet published to the Chrome Web Store.

---

## AI & Voice Modeling

* Content is summarized with a low-temperature prompt for stability
* Writing voices are represented as **explicit voice profiles**
* Custom voices are generated by analyzing descriptions (or samples)
* Comment generation strictly follows the selected voice profile

---

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* pnpm

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run the web app (backend + frontend)

```bash
pnpm --filter @commentto/web dev
```

Web app runs at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Build the Chrome extension

```bash
pnpm --filter @commentto/extension build
```

Load the extension from:

```
apps/extension/dist
```

via `chrome://extensions` → “Load unpacked”.

---

## Deployment

* The web app and API routes are deployed on [Vercel](https://commentto-web.vercel.app/).
* The Chrome extension is built against the live API and loaded locally
* Only `apps/web` is deployed (monorepo-safe)
* The Chrome extension consumes the live API endpoints

---

## Future Improvements

* Chrome Web Store publication (if product direction warrants it) 
* Rate limiting
* Edge / Firefox extension support
* Public API access
* Optional accounts (if product direction changes)

---

## Why This Project Matters

Commentto is not a tutorial clone.

It involved:

* Real architectural trade-offs
* Monorepo design and cleanup
* Chrome MV3 constraints
* AI prompt engineering for consistency
* Designing for actual user behavior

This project was built with a **product engineer mindset**, not just code output.

---

If you want, next we can:

* tighten this README for a specific audience (recruiters vs users)
* write the **case study section** for your portfolio
* prepare Chrome Web Store listing copy
* or draft a launch post

Just tell me the next move.
